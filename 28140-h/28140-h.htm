<h2>THE STARLINGS AND THE SPARROWS.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Look</span> here, my dear," said a starling to her mate: "in
our pretty summer-villa a pair of saucy sparrows have
taken up their abode. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" cried Mr. Starling, who was calmly
standing on a fence; "why, rout them out, of course; give
them notice to quit."</p>

<p>"That we will do," replied Mrs. Starling. "Here, you
beggars, you: out of that house! You've no business
there. Be off!"</p>

<p>"What's all that?" piped Mrs. Sparrow, looking out of
her little round doorway. "Go away, you impudent tramp!
Don't come near our house."</p>

<p>"It is not your house!" said Mr. Starling, springing
nimbly to a bough, and confronting Mrs. Sparrow.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> ours!" cried Mr. Sparrow, looking down from
the roof of the house. "I have the title-deeds. Stand up
for your rights, my love!"</p>

<p>"Yes, stand up for your rights. I'll back you," said Mrs.
Sparrow's brother-in-law, taking position on a branch just
at the foot of the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll see about that, you thieves!" cried Mrs. Starling,
in a rage, making a dash at Mrs. Sparrow's brother-in-law.</p>

<p>But two of Mrs. Sparrow's cousins came to the rescue
just then, and attacked Mrs. Starling in the rear.</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Starling flew at Mrs. Sparrow. Mr.
Sparrow, without more delay, went at Mr. Starling. Mrs.
Sparrow's brother-in-law paid his respects to Mrs. Starling.
There was a lively fight.</p>

<p>It ended in the defeat of the sparrows. The starlings
were too big for them.
The sparrows retreated
in good order, and left
the starlings to enjoy
their triumph.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus165.png" width="250" height="227" alt="In the tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Now, my dear,"
said Mr. Starling, "go
in, and put the house
in order. I'll warrant
those vulgar sparrows
have made a nice mess
in there. Sweep the
floors, dust the furniture, and get the beds made. I'll stay
here in the garden, and rest myself."</p>

<p>"Just like that husband of mine!" muttered Mrs. Starling:
"I must do all the work, while he has all the fun.
But I suppose there's no help for it."</p>

<p>So she flew up to the door of the house; but, to her
surprise, she could not get through it: the opening was not
large enough.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Starling," said she, "I do believe we have
made a mistake. This is not our house, after all."</p>

<p>"Why did you say it was, then?" said Mr. Starling, in a
huff. "Here I have got a black eye, and a lame claw, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a sprained wing, and have lost two feathers out of my tail,
all through your blunder. You ought to be ashamed of
yourself, Mrs. Starling!"</p>

<p>"I own that I was hasty," said poor Mrs. Starling; "but
I meant well."</p>

<p>"Yes, you thought the sparrows were thieves, and so did
I. But it turns out, that we are no better than burglars
ourselves; and, what's more, we shall have a whole army of
sparrows back upon us before long. We had better take
ourselves off." And off they flew.</p>

<h2>KATIE AND WAIF.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> Katie Sinclair, and Waif is my dog. Now, as everybody
who knows him says he is the nicest dog in the world,
I will tell my "Nursery" friends why people think so.</p>

<p>First I must tell you how I got him, and how he came to
have such an odd name. One cold, rainy day, about three
years ago, I heard a strange noise under the window, and
ran to the door to see what it was. There stood a homely
little puppy, dripping wet, shivering from the cold, and
crying, oh, so mournfully!</p>

<p>I took him in, and held him before the fire till he was dry
and warm. Then I got him some nice fresh milk, which
he drank eagerly; and he looked up in my face in such a
thankful way, that he quite won my heart.</p>

<p>"Poor little dog!" said I. "He hasn't had a very nice time
in this world so far; but I will ask mamma to let him stay
and be my dog." Mamma consented; and, if that dog has
not enjoyed himself since then, it is not my fault.</p>

<p>I was bothered not a little to find a name for him. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
wanted one, you see, that would remind me always of the
way he came to me,&mdash;not a common name, such as other
little dogs have. No; I did not want a "Carlo," or a
"Rover," or a "Watch." After trying in vain to think
of a name fit for him, I asked mamma to help me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/illus167.png" width="342" height="450" alt="Kate and Waif" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>She said, "Call him Waif." I was such a little goose
then (that was over three years ago, you know), that I had
to ask her what "Waif" meant.</p>

<p>"A waif," said she, "is something found, of which nobody
knows the owner. On that account 'Waif' would be a
good name for your puppy." So I gave him that name,
and he soon got to know and answer to it.</p>

<p>Waif grew fast, and we taught him ever so many tricks.
He has learned to be very useful too, as I shall show you.</p>

<p>On a shelf in the kitchen stands a small basket, with his
name, in red letters, printed upon it. To this basket he
goes every morning, and barks. When Ellen the cook
hears him, she takes the basket down, and places the handle
in his mouth. Then he goes to mamma, and waits patiently
till she is ready, when he goes down town with her, and
brings back the meat for dinner.</p>

<p>When papa gets through dinner, he always pushes back
his chair, and says, "Now, Waif:" and Waif knows what
that means; for he jumps up from where he has been lying,&mdash;and,
oh! such fun as we have with him then! He walks
on his hind-feet, speaks for meat, and catches crumbs.</p>

<p>Last summer I went out to Lafayette to visit grandma.
Mamma says, that, while I was away, Waif would go to my
room, and sniff at the bed-clothes, and go away whining and
crying bitterly. When I came back, he was nearly beside
himself with delight.</p>

<p>We never found out where he came from that rainy
day. But I don't love him a bit the less because he was a
poor, friendless puppy; and when I look into his good,
honest brown eyes, and think what a true friend he is, I
put my arms around his neck, and whisper in his ear, that
I would not change him for the handsomest dog in the
country.</p>

<h2>AMY AND ROBERT IN CHINA.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span> and Robert, with their papa and mamma, live in
China, in a place called Foochow. They came here last
January, when Amy was just three years old, and Robert
a little over one year. They came all the way from Boston
by water.</p>

<p>They have a good grandma at home, who sends Amy
"The Nursery" every month, and she is never tired of
hearing the nice stories.</p>

<p>Out here, the children see many things that you little
folks in America know nothing about. When they go to
ride, they do not go in a carriage drawn by horses, but in a
chair resting on two long poles, carried by some Chinamen
called <i>coolies</i>. When it is pleasant, and the sun is not too
hot, the chair is open; but, if it rains, there is a close cover
to fit over it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>It is so warm here, that flowers blossom in the garden all
winter; and Amy is very fond of picking them, and putting
them into vases. When it is too warm to go into the
garden, she has a pot of earth on the shady piazza, and
the cooly picks her flowers, to plant in it.</p>

<p>Foochow is on a large river; and the children like much
to go out in the sail-boats, called "house-boats." These
boats are fitted up just like a house, with a dining-room,
sleeping-room, bath-room, and pantry.</p>

<p>The night before Fourth of July, Amy and Robert started
with their papa, mamma, and Amah (their colored nurse),
and went to Sharp Peak, on the seashore, twenty-five miles
from here. They found the boat very nice to sleep in,
but were glad enough to get into their own beds the next
night.</p>

<p>I am afraid you would not know what these little children
say, if you should hear them talk; for they pick up words
from their Amah, and do not speak like little American
girls and boys.</p>

<p>By and by I shall have more to tell you about them.</p>

<h2>ABOUT TWO OLD HORSES.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my great-great-grandfather's barn-yard stood an old-fashioned
well, with a long sweep or pole, by which the
bucket was pulled up. This well was used entirely for
the horses and cattle.</p>

<p>Grandfather had a horse named Pete, who would walk
out of his stall every morning, go to the well, take the
pole, by which the bucket was attached to the well-sweep,
between his teeth, and thus pull up the bucket until it
rested on the shelf made for it. Then old Pete would drink
the water which he had taken so much pains to get.</p>

<p>But one of my uncles had a horse even more knowing
than old Pete. This horse was named Whitey. Every
Sunday morning, when the church-bell rang, Uncle George
would lead Whitey out of his stall, harness him, drive him
to church, and tie him in a certain shed, where he would
stand quietly till church was done.</p>

<p>After a while, Whitey grew so used to this weekly performance,
that, when the bells rang, he would walk out of
his stall, and wait to be harnessed. One Sunday morning,
Old Whitey, on hearing the bells, walked out of his stall
as usual, and patiently waited for Uncle George. But it
happened that uncle was sick that morning, and none of the
family felt like going to church.</p>

<p>I do not really know what Whitey's thoughts were; but
I have no doubt that they were something like this: "Well,
well! I guess my master is not going to church this morning;
but that is no reason why I should not go. I must go
now, or I shall be late."</p>

<p>Whitey had waited so long, that he was rather late; but
he jogged steadily along to his post in the shed, and there
took his stand, as usual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as old Mr. Lane, who sat in one of the back-pews
and always came out of church before anybody else,
appeared at the door, Whitey started for home. At the
door of the house he was greeted by several members of
the family, who had just discovered his absence, and who
learned the next day, from Mr. Lane, that old Whitey had
merely been attending strictly to his church-duties.</p>

<h2>FOR ETHEL.</h2>

"<span class="smcap">Good-by</span>! little Ethel, good-by!" says the Light;<br />
For what does my sleepy one need but the night?&mdash;<br />
The soft quiet night, like a great downy wing,<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Good-by till the dawning:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Some bright star will keep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Its watch o'er your pillow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When you are asleep!</span><br />
<br />
"Good-by, little Ethel," so many things say,&mdash;<br />
The wind, that has played in the grasses all day,<br />
The pretty red squirrels you never can catch,<br />
And the kitten, that tries all your playthings to snatch.<br />

<h2>BABY'S EXPLOIT.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first place baby had her bath. Such a time!
Mamma talked as fast and as funny as could be; and the
baby crowed and kicked as if she understood every word.</p>

<p>Presently came the clean clothes,&mdash;a nice, dainty pile,
fresh from yesterday's ironing. Baby Lila was seven
months old that very May morning; but not a sign had she
given yet of trying to creep: so the long white dresses still
went on, though mamma said every day, "I must make
some short dresses for this child. She's too old to wear
these dragging things any longer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>When baby had been dressed and kissed, she was set
down in the middle of the clean kitchen-floor, on her
own rug, hedged in by soft white pillows. There she sat,
serene and happy, surveying her playthings with quizzical
eyes; while her mamma gathered up bath-tub, towel, and
cast-off clothes, and went up stairs to put them away.</p>

<p>Left to herself, Lila first made a careful review of her
treasures. The feather duster was certainly present. So
was the old rattle. Was the door-knob there? and the
string of spools? Yes; and so was the little red pincushion,
dear to baby's color-loving eyes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus174.png" width="200" height="171" alt="Baby and feather duster" title="" />
</div>

<p>She was slowly poking over the things in her lap, when
mamma came back, bringing a pot of yeast to set by the
open fire-place, where a small fire burned leisurely on this
cool May morning. She put a little tin plate on the top of
the pot, kissed the precious baby, and then went out again.
Baby Lila was used to being
left alone, though seldom out
of mamma's hearing. At such
times she would sit among the
pillows, tossing her trinkets all
about, and crowing at her own
performances. Sometimes she
would drop over against a pillow,
and go to sleep.</p>

<p>But this morning Lila had no intention of going to sleep.
She flourished the duster, and laughed at the pincushion;
then gazed meditatively at the bright window, and reflected
gravely on the broad belt of sunshine lying across the floor.
That speculation over, she fell to hugging the cherished
duster, rocking back and forth as if it were another baby.</p>

<p>A smart little snap of the fire,&mdash;a "How-do-you-do?"
from the fire-place,&mdash;made the baby twist her little body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to look at it. She watched the small flames dancing in and
out, as long as her neck could bear the twist.</p>

<p>As she turned back again, her eyes fell on the pot of
yeast. Oh! wasn't that her own tin plate shining in the
sunlight? Didn't she make music on it with a spoon every
meal-time? and hadn't her little gums felt of every A,
B, C, around its edge? Didn't she want it now? And
wouldn't she have it too?</p>

<p>How she ever did it, nobody knows. How she ever got
over the pillows, and made her way across to the fire-place
in her long, hindering skirts, nobody can tell.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus175.png" width="250" height="203" alt="Baby on the floor" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mamma was busy in another room, when she heard the
little plate clatter on the kitchen-floor. Not a thought of
the real mischief-maker entered
her head. She only said to herself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn't know the cat was
in there. Well, she'll find out
her mistake. I'm not going in
till I get this pie done, any
way. The baby's all right, and
that's enough."</p>

<p>As soon as mamma's hands were at liberty, she thought
she would just look in and see what kept the darling so
quiet. "All right," indeed! What a spectacle she beheld!</p>

<p>On the bricks before the fire, her pretty white skirts
much too near the ashes, sat Baby Lila, having a glorious
time. She had found her dear little plate empty; but the
brown pitcher was full enough. She had dropped the plate,
dipped the feather-duster into the yeast, and proceeded to
spread it about, on her clean clothes, on the bricks, on the
floor, everywhere.</p>

<p>So, when mamma opened the door, she saw this wee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
daughter besmeared from head to foot, the yeast dripping
over her head and face as she held the duster aloft in both
hands.</p>

<p>Just then papa came in by another door. "O John!
do you see this child! What if she had put the duster into
the fire instead of the yeast!" Mamma shuddered as she
took little Lila into her lap for another bath and change of
clothes. Papa standing by said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You don't seem to mind having all that to do again."</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't. To think how near she was to that
fire! I can never be thankful enough that she dusted the
yeast instead of the coals. But how do you suppose she
ever got over there?"</p>

<h2>THE FOX AND THE CROW.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">A crow</span>, one day, stole a nice bit of cheese,<br />
And flew up in a tree to eat it at her ease.<br />
A sly young Fox, who was passing below,<br />
Saw her as she flew, and he said, "Oh, ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Madam Crow."</span><br />
<br />
"What a fine bird you are, with your feathers so gay!<br />
As brilliant as the rainbow, and fairer than the day.<br />
If your voice is as sweet as your form would show,<br />
Then sing me a song: pray don't say 'No,'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Madam Crow."</span><br />
<br />
The crow began her song, when down fell the cheese:<br />
The fox sprang and caught it as quickly as you please;<br />
And as he trotted off, he said, "Oh, ho!<br />
That is just what I wanted. I'll go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Madam Crow."</span><br />

<h2>THE SWALLOWS AND THE ROBIN.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">The</span> woods were showing autumn tints<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of crimson and of gold;</span><br />
The sunny days were growing short,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The evenings long and cold:</span><br />
So the swallows held a parliament,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And voted it was time</span><br />
To bid farewell to northern skies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seek a warmer clime.</span><br />
<br />
Southward with glad and rapid flight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They flew for many a mile,</span><br />
Till in a quiet woodland glen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They stopped to rest a while:</span><br />
A streamlet rippled in the dell;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on a hawthorn-tree</span><br />
A robin-redbreast sat alone,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And carolled merrily.</span><br />
<br />
The wandering swallows listened,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And eagerly said they,</span><br />
"O pretty bird! your notes are sweet:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come, fly with us away.</span><br />
We're following the sunshine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For it is bright and warm:</span><br />
We're leaving winter far behind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all its cold and storm.</span><br />
<br />
"The iron ground will yield no food,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The berries will be few;</span><br />
Half-starved with hunger and with cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor bird, what will you do?"</span><br />
"Nay, nay," said he, "when frost is hard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the leaves are dead,</span><br />
I know that kindly little hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will give me crumbs of bread."</span><br />

<h2>BIRDIE'S PIG STORY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I told</span> my story first, as mammas usually do; and it was
all about a naughty little pig, who did not mind his mother
when she bade him stay in the sty, but crawled through a
hole in the wall.</p>

<p>Of course this pig got into the garden, and was whipped
by the farmer, and bitten by the dog, and had all sorts of
unpleasant things happen to him, till he was glad to get
back again to the sty.</p>

<p>"Now I'll tell you a pig story," said Birdie, with a very
wise look.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Once there was a big mother-pig, and she had <i>lots</i> of children-pigs.
One was spotted, and his name was Spotty; one's tail curled, and he
was Curly; another was white, and he was Whitey; another was Browny;
and another was Greeny."</p></div>

<p>"Oh, dear! the idea of a <i>green</i> pig!" said I.</p>

<p>But Birdie's eyes were fixed on the floor. He was too busy
thinking of his story to notice my remark. He went on,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One day the pigs found a hole in the wall, and they crawled through,&mdash;all
of 'em, the mother-pig and all; and, when they got out, they ran
off, grunting with&mdash;with joy. And when the farmer saw them, he went
after them on a horse; but he couldn't catch them, for they all ran down
under a bridge where there had been a brook; but the water was all
dried up.</p>

<p>"Then the farmer got a long pole, and poked under the bridge; but
he couldn't reach them. He put some potatoes down there too, but the
pigs weren't going to be coaxed out. And when they had staid as long
as they wanted to, they came out themselves, and got home before the
farmer did."</p></div>

<p>That was the story, and I forgot to ask how they got
home before the farmer did unless he drove them; but I
think they must have gone home across the field, because
it is plain that Birdie's pigs did just as they liked all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
through. What I did ask was, "Well, what was the good
of it all?" for I thought nobody ought to tell a story without
meaning some good by it.</p>

<p>"<i>Why, they got some fresh air!</i>" cried Birdie, triumphantly;
and considering that most farmers keep their pig-sties
in a filthy condition, which can't be healthy for the
pigs, nor for those who eat them, I thought Birdie's story
had a very good moral, which is only another way of saying
that it had a good lesson in it.</p>

<h2>OUR FRIEND THE ROBIN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> very hard winter, a robin came, day after day, to
our window-sill. He was fed with crumbs, and soon became
tame enough not to fly away when we opened the window.
One cold day we found the little thing hopping about the
kitchen. He had flown in at the window, and did not
attempt to fly out again when we came near.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>We did not like to drive him out in the bitter cold: so
we put him in a cage, in which he soon made himself quite
at home. Sometimes we would let him out in the room,
and he would perch on our finger, and eat from our hand
without the least sign of fear.</p>

<p>When the spring came on, we opened the cage-door and
let him go. At first he was not at all inclined to leave us;
but after a while he flew off, and we thought we should
never see him again.</p>

<p>All through the summer and autumn, the cage stood on a
table in a corner of the kitchen. We often thought of the
little robin, and were rather sorry that the cage was empty.</p>

<p>When the winter set in, we fancied we saw our old friend
again hopping about outside the window. We were by no
means sure that it was the same robin; but, just to see
what he would do, we opened the window, and set the cage
in its old place.</p>

<p>Then we all left the room for a few minutes. When we
returned, we found, to our great delight, that the bird was
in the cage. He seemed to know us as we petted him and
chirruped to him; and we felt certain that it was our dear
old friend.</p>

<h2>FRANK'S HIGH HORSE.</h2>

<div class='story'>
<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> wanted a high horse:
so he took the sewing-chair, put
the hassock on it, put the sofa-pillow
on that, and mounted.</p>

<p>How he got seated up there
so nicely I don't know; but I
know just how he got down.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The horse did not mind the
bridle, but he would not stand
the whip. He reared, lost his
balance, and fell over.</p>

<p>Down came Frank with sofa-pillow,
hassock, and all. By
good luck, he was not hurt; but
he will not try to ride that horse
again.</p></div>

<h2>SAGACITY OF A HORSE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A Young</span> gentleman bought a hunting-mare from a
farmer at Malton in England, and took her with him to
Whitby, a distance of nearly sixty miles. One Wednesday
morning the mare was missing from the field where her
owner had placed her. A search was made for her, but
with no success.</p>

<p>The next day the search was renewed. The owner and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
his groom went some ten miles, and were told that the mare
had crossed the railway the morning before. At this point
the trail was easy. The mare had taken the high road to
her old home at Malton.</p>

<p>Six men had tried, but in vain, to stop her. At a place
called Pickering, she jumped a load of wood and the railway
gates, and then, finding herself in her old hunting country,
made a bee-line for home. In doing this, she had to swim
two rivers, and cross a railway.</p>

<p>She was found at her old home, rather lame, and with one
shoe off, but otherwise no worse for her gallop of nearly
sixty miles across the country,&mdash;all done in one day; for
her old owner found her on Wednesday night, standing at
the gate of the field where she had grazed for two previous
years. Was she not a pretty clever horse?</p>

<h2>PHANTOM.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have a little white dog whose name is Phantom.
This is his portrait. I hope you are glad to meet him.
Ask him to shake hands. He would do so at once if you
could only see him in reality.</p>

<p>When he was only a few months old, he followed us all
to church without our knowing it; nor did we see him, till,
in the most solemn part of the service, we heard a patter,
patter, patter, coming up the aisle, and there stood Phantom
at the door of our pew. In his mouth was a long-handled
feather duster, which he had found in some obscure corner
of the building, and where it had been put (as it was supposed)
carefully out of everybody's way.</p>

<p>Phantom is very intelligent, and has learned a number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
tricks. He can understand what is said to him better than
any dog I ever knew; but he is best known among the
children here for his love of music and singing.</p>

<p>He has only learned one song yet; but he knows that as
soon as he hears it. Wherever he may be,&mdash;up stairs, or
down stairs, or out of doors,&mdash;if he hears that song, he will
sit up, throw his head back, and you will hear his voice
taking part in the music.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus187.png" width="500" height="374" alt="Playing for Phantom" title="" />
</div>

<p>You may sing a dozen songs, all in about the same tone;
but he will take no notice till he hears the tune he has
learned, and then he will sing with you&mdash;not in a bark or
a yelp, but in a pure, clear voice, as if he enjoyed it.</p>

<p>If you could see him sitting up, with his nose in the air,
his mouth open, and his fore-paws moving as if playing the
piano, and could hear his music, I am sure you would laugh
till the tears came into your eyes.</p>
